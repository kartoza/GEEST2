Isochrones are derived from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network with the use of travel distances or times as input to estimate ease of access to the input locations at five incrementally increasing measurement intervals. The largest interval being the maximum distance or time women would travel to reach these locations. The algorithm produces five catchment areas based on the road network. A scoring system ranging from 5 to 1 is assigned to the catchment area polygons, reflecting the decreasing order of accessibility. Areas outside these catchment areas receive a score of zero.Step 1: This step is repeated for each facility type.  Input: Point locations (.shp) of amenities related to women's role as caregivers, including childcare, primary and secondary schools, markets, grocery stores and recreational areas. Travel mode: The user can select walking or driving as a travel mode and it is recommended that the same travel mode should be selected for all accessibility factors. The default travel mode is walking due to its inclusive nature. Measurement: The default measurement for travel is distance in meters which is most appropriate for walking. If driving is selected as travel mode, time in minutes is a more appropriate measurement. Travel increments: The travel increments for walking are loaded by default and based on evidence from literature. If evidence from the local context suggests alternative thresholds and increments are more appropriate, the user can alter these default values. If the selected travel mode is driving the equal measurement increments should be in minutes, and informed by the local context  (for example, if the user knows that the maximum time that women spend driving is 30 minutes, the increment input would be 6, 12, 18, 24, 30). Step 2: The algorithm aggregates all raster layers created in step 1 by calculating the mean score for each pixel. Output: A raster file containing values ranging from 0 to 5 is saved to the output directory. A value of 5 identifies areas that are within the catchment defined by the smallest travel increment for all amenities (i.e., the areas where accessibility for women is highest). A value of 0 indicates areas that are outside of the catchment defined by the maximum travel increment for all amenities (i.e., no amenities are accessible to women from these areas).

Isochrones are derived from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network with the use of travel distances or times as input to estimate ease of access to the public transport stops at five incrementally increasing measurement intervals. The largest interval being the maximum distance or time women would travel to reach these locations. The algorithm produces five catchment areas based on the road network. A scoring system ranging from 5 to 1 is assigned to the catchment area polygons, reflecting the decreasing order of accessibility. Areas outside these catchment areas receive a score of zero. Input: Point locations (.shp) of public transport stops. Travel mode: The user can select walking or driving as a travel mode and it is recommended that the same travel mode should be selected for all accessibility factors. The default travel mode is walking due to its inclusive nature. Measurement: The default measurement for travel is distance in meters which is most appropriate for walking. If driving is selected as travel mode, time in minutes is a more appropriate measurement. Travel increments: The travel increments for walking are loaded by default and based on evidence from literature. If evidence from the local context suggests alternative thresholds and increments are more appropriate, the user can alter these default values. If the selected travel mode is driving the equal measurement increments should be in minutes, and informed by the local context (for example, if the user knows that the maximum time that women spend driving is 30 minutes, the increment input would be 6, 12, 18, 24, 30). Output: A raster file containing values ranging from 0 to 5 is saved to the output directory. A value of 5 identifies areas that are within the catchment defined by the smallest travel increment for transport stops (i.e., the areas where transport accessibility for women is highest). A value of 0 indicates areas that are outside of the catchment defined by the maximum travel increment for transport stops (i.e., no transport stops are accessible to women from these areas).

Isochrones are derived from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network with the use of travel distances or times as input to estimate ease of access to financial facilities at five incrementally increasing measurement intervals. The largest interval being the maximum distance or time women would travel to reach these locations. The algorithm produces five catchment areas based on the road network. A scoring system ranging from 5 to 1 is assigned to the catchment area polygons, reflecting the decreasing order of accessibility. Areas outside these catchment areas receive a score of zero. Input: Point locations (.shp) of financial facilities such as banks and ATMs. Travel mode: The user can select walking or driving as a travel mode and it is recommended that the same travel mode should be selected for all accessibility factors. The default travel mode is walking due to its inclusive nature. Measurement: The default measurement for travel is distance in meters which is most appropriate for walking. If driving is selected as travel mode, time in minutes is a more appropriate measurement. Travel increments: The travel increments for walking are loaded by default and based on evidence from literature. If evidence from the local context suggests alternative thresholds and increments are more appropriate, the user can alter these default values. If the selected travel mode is driving the equal measurement increments should be in minutes, and informed by the local context (for example, if the user knows that the maximum time that women spend driving is 30 minutes, the increment input would be 6, 12, 18, 24, 30). Output: A raster file containing values ranging from 0 to 5 is saved to the output directory. A value of 5 identifies areas that are within the catchment defined by the smallest travel increment for a financial facility (i.e., the areas where access to financial facilities for women is highest). A value of 0 indicates areas that are outside of the catchment defined by the maximum travel increment for financial facilities (i.e., no financial facilities are accessible to women from these areas).

Drought: Global Drought Hazard based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)Step 1 For each layer representing a different class of environmental hazard, the input layer is set. The algorithm reclassifies the input field such that low-risk areas are assigned a score of 5, medium-risk areas are assigned a score of 2, and high-risk areas are assigned a score of 0. Step 2 The algorithm identifies all raster layers created in step 1 and aggregates them by calculating the mean score for each pixel. The default raster output filename does not need to be altered unless the user wishes. Output: A raster file containing values ranging from 0 to 5 is saved to the output directory.
