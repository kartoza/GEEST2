Geest Work Review:
------------------

+ Last week we focussed on the Contextual Dimension
* Removed all dependencies for rasterio, pandas, ORS plugin (we will use the API directly rather)
* Implemented raster based workflow rather than vector one that we had originally planned
* Implemented study area prep logic that explodes polygons, generates per-feature bboxes and analysis area bbox
* Implemented the project concept with directory structure for model.json and study_area.gpgp
* Created the autopackage builder and tested that on Windows
* Implemented the index score workflow
* Implemented aggregation workflows
* Workflows run in threads in hte background so they dont block QGIS UI


Timeline for Oct:
-----------------

Oct 1-4: Week one: complete aggregator workflow logic, improve UX flow
Oct 7-11: Week two: implement all other analysis types
